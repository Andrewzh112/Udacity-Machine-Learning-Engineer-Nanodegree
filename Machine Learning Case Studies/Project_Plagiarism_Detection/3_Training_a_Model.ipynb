The reason behind this is because there were only 100 data points and the number of features are also fewer than usual deep NNs. Even a model with no hidden layers and a few epochs did not yield good results. The reason behind this is possibly because of unbalanced data and the few number of training data. I eventually used a linear learner which takes into account of unbalanced data and had a pretty successful final model. (test accuracy of 96%)."
