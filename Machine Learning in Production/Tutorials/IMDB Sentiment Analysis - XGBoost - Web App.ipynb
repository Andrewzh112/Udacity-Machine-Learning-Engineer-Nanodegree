The first is to use the low level functionality of SageMaker which requires knowing each of the objects involved in the SageMaker environment. The second is to use the high level functionality in which certain choices have been made on the user's behalf. The low level approach benefits from allowing the user a great deal of flexibility while the high level approach makes development much quicker. For our purposes we will opt to use the high level approach although using the low-level approach is certainly an option.\n",

What this method does is upload the data to the default bucket (which is created if it does not exist) into the path described by the key_prefix variable. To see this for yourself, once you have uploaded the data files, go to the S3 console and look to see where the files have been uploaded.\n",

We can, if we wish, expose the actual URL that our model's endpoint is receiving data from, however, if we just send it data ourselves we will not get anything in return. This is because the endpoint created by SageMaker requires the entity accessing it have the correct permissions. So, we would need to somehow authenticate our web app with AWS.\n",

Remember that when we constructed and tested our model we started with a movie review, then we simplified it by removing any html formatting and punctuation, then we constructed a bag of words embedding and the resulting vector is what we sent to our model. All of this needs to be done to our user input as well.\n",

We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs.

In addition, we will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.\n",
